Requirements:
-------------
  A C++ compiler (both gcc and clang have been tested).
  LLVM (versions 2.9 and 3.4 have been tested, but version 3.0, 3.1,
        3.2, and 3.3 should also work).
  GMP

Build instructions:
-------------------
  You will need to modify the Makefile and set the following variables:
  LLVM_MAJOR, LLVM_MINOR, LLVM_LIB_DIR, LLVM_INCLUDE_DIR.  You might
  need to add "-fno-rtti" to COMPILEFLAGS (if your installation of
  LLVM was built using this flag).

  "make llvm2kittel" builds the termination analysis frontend "llvm2kittel"

  "make llvm2kittel.static" builds the statically linked termination
  analysis frontend "llvm2kittel.static"
